###Features:
-Ajax submit
-PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript syntax highlighting (codemirror)


Notes:
Needs magic quotes to be turned off. (Although new versions of php no longer implements this)

####Warning:
Due to security issues of eval(), it is strongly recommended not to upload this to a live web server, or at least use password protection for the folder. It is also recommended disable some functions in your php settings.
