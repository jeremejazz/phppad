PHPPad
======

inspired from codepad.org. I created this for personal use just to run php codes without creating a new file. Uses codemirror for sy for syntax highlighting.

###Features:
-Ajax submit
-PHP syntax highlighting (using codemirror)


Notes:
Needs magic quotes to be turned off. (Although new versions of php no longer implements this)

####Warning:
Due to security issues of eval(), it is strongly recommended not to upload this to a live web server, or at least use password protection for the folder. It is also recommended disable some functions in your php settings.
